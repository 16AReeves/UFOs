// Printing a string with JavaScript
console.log("Hello, world!");
	// print() does exist in js, but it will try to print to a printer 




// Notes
// statements perform actions and expressions create values
// assigning a variable is an ex of a statement: ex: let y=2;
// using arithmetic to create a new value is an expression.
// always use let instead of var when declaring anything
	// professor went over this in class on 18May22 around 8:20pm
	// another way is to declare it as a const (constant), it cannot be used again or redeclared, but some attributes within the {} condition can be updated
	// let allows you to update the value of the variable 
	// var usage is global, and applies to the whole program not just one line
		//doesn't allow updates or changes and can eventually break your code, basically DON'T USE VAR
// code blocks are denoted by {}

// 11.2.1 add data.js to the repository
